+++

This is an essential read for anyone interested in learning karate, or any prominent martial art for that matter. The book describes both the physical and psychological fundamentals of the art, and touches on its history. The author, Funakoshi, is credited for popularizing karate, facilitating the spread of its practice from his village in Okinawa, to Tokyo, and eventually to the United States. Much of modern day karate can trace its roots back to Funakoshi.

The read is essential not for the learnings related to the physical elements of karate, but its mental and spiritual principals. Karate is as much a vehicle to embolden the mind and heart as it is one to train the body. The lessons that karate seeks to impart on its students can develop one's character towards what should be considered a model for society.

Funakoshi weaves his basic teachings through the story of his life, for it becomes clear that the two were inseparable. He was one of the few that truly adopted karate-do as a way of life - for him, life was karate, and karate was life.

### Notable Excerpts

>...Any karate adept who boasts about how many boards or tiles he can break with his bare hand or who claims to be able to rip flesh into strips or tear ribs from their cage is one who has very little conception of what true karate is

>Karate is a defensive art and must never serve offensive purposes. 'Be careful... About the words you speak, for if you are boastful you will make a great many enemies. Never forget the old saying that a strong wind may destroy a sturdy tree, but the willow bows, and the wind passes through. The great values karate are prudence and humility.

>1. You must be deadly serious in training.
>2. Train with both heart and soul without worrying about theory. True practice is done not with words but with the entire body
>4. Avoid self-conceit and dogmatism
>5. Try to see yourself as you truly are and try to adopt what is meritorious in the work of others.
