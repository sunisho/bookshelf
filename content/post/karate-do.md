This is an essential read for anyone interested in learning karate, or any prominent martial art for that matter. The book describes both the physical and psychological fundamentals of the art, and touches on its history. The author, Funakoshi, is credited for popularizing karate, facilitating the spread of its practice from his village in Okinawa, to Tokyo, and eventually to the United States. Much of modern day karate can trace its roots back to Funakoshi.

The read is essential not for the learnings related to the physical elements of karate, but its mental and spiritual principals. Karate is as much a vehicle to embolden the mind and heart as it is one to train the body. The lessons that Funakoshi touches on, and karate seeks to impart on its students, can develop one's character towards that which we consider a model for society.

Funakoshi weaves his basic teachings through the story of his life, for it is obvious that the two are inseparable. He was one of the few that truly adopted karate-do as a way of life - for him, life was karate, and karate was life.
