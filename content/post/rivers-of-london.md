The Rivers of London series, now at 5 books and counting, is what would happen if Sherlock Holmes and Harry Potter had a baby. Murder mysteries in a world very similar to ours, only for the small difference that magic does indeed exist, and our law enforcement is equipped to protect us from its malintentioned practictioners. The writing is sarcastic and witty with a dry sense of humor, and leaves the reader wanting more every time.
