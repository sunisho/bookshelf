It's not the aliens you should be worried about.

Yancey stakes his claim on the age-old alien invasion story. But, like most good writers in this genre, he attempts to predict how the human race would actually respond to such unknown catastrophe. He also ventures a few steps beyond the likes of H.G. Wells and tries to figure out what would happen if the aliens, with all of their knowledge and evolved ways, found a way to survive on our planet. His prediction is not encouraging, and shines a light on an often ignored facet of human capability.
