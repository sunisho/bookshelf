A century before Game of Thrones, two unlikely heroes wandered Westeros. These are the tales of Dunk and Egg.

A collection of three short stories that satiates starving ASOIF fans as we wait for George R.R. Martin to complete his epic.

### Notable Excerpts

> “A hedge knight is the truest kind of knight, Dunk,” the old man had told him, a long long time ago. “Other knights serve the lords who keep them, or from whom they hold their lands, but we serve where we will, for men whose causes we believe in. Every knight swears to protect the weak and innocent, but we keep the vow best, I think.”

> Hard things only grow harder if you put them off.

> Kings rise and fall, Dunk thought, and cows and smallfolk go about their business
