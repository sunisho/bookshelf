A horrible continuation of the Millennium Series. Stieg Larsson is likely rolling in his grave, regretting the day he ever passed his torch to David Lagercrantz.

Lagercrantz writes the way a high school student would, with played out forms of expression and phrases. It was the first time I've ever read a book and was angry at the way it was written. It was beyond pedestrian - for even that level of writing is entertaining and needed. This felt like no effort was given at all to either honoring the beauty of language, or developing his own unique voice.

I might be alone on this, but this book was one of my least favorite books I've read in quite some time.

All that being said, it could have more to do with the translation to English. I wonder what experience I would have reading in his native language of Swedish - a mystery that will undoubtedly remain unsolved.

Regardless, there was one quote that stood out (the impending irony isn't lost on me)..
