Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage details what still stands today as one of the greatest adventures ever undertaken by man.

### Notable Excerpts

> Shackleton rechristened her Endurance, in keeping with the motto of his family, Fortitudine vincimus—“By endurance we conquer.”

And these decisions were made with lightning speed. There is no record of any interview that Shackleton conducted with a prospective expedition member lasting much more than five minutes.

> The waters are hid as with a stone...And the face of the deep is frozen.

> Their position was 68°38½´ South, 52°28´ West—a place where no man had ever been before, nor could they conceive that any man would ever want to be again.

<!-- -->
> “I read somewhere that all a man needs to be happy is a full stomach and warmth,

<!-- -->
> “Hope tells a flattering tale.”

It is a battle against a tireless enemy in which man never actually wins; the most that he can hope for is not to be defeated.
