After hearing that Westworld had some nods to Huxley's dystopia, arguably one of the first dystopias of its kind, I was motivated to finally read the book that would go on to inspire science fiction writers for now almost a century. Huxley's cynical view of society and its doomed destination continues to be a nice check on the norms that we consider perfectly acceptable. He offers a world wherein our constant pursuit for happiness, knowledge, technological & scientific advancement, and personal fulfillment could paradoxically lead us to a world where that pursuit ceases to exist, and thereby potentially invalidating the very meaning of life itself. As a reader, I saw bits of myself in almost all of the main characters, and in those same characters I saw other traits that were completely unrelatable. So is the nature of our own reality: there is no one white knight or dark villian - in us all lie the entire spectrum of character, the absolute propensity for mistake, and a persistent drive to, above all, serve none other but ourselves.
