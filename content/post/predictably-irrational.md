In league with the likes of Freakonomics and touching on some similar topics as Hooked, Predictably Irrational is a great introduction to behavioral economics, making a great case to question the assumptions long held true by standard economic theory. Ariely uses a mix of anecdotal and empirical evidence to repeatedly show that humans are irrational, and their irrationality can be predicted. Essential reading for marketers, economists, psychologists, and even the everyday person looking to become more aware of all the forces that shape our decisions.
