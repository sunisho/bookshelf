Down the rabbit hole, we go. Lewis Carrol makes readers feel as if they are actually in a dream, flitting from one realization to the next without much transition or forethought. The facts themselves are unintelligible, yet still make sense within the context of the present. A fun, although at times confusing, read.

### Notable Excerpts

And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.

> Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.

> 'Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'<br>'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.<br>'I don't much care where--' said Alice.<br>'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.<br>'--so long as I get somewhere,' Alice added as an explanation.<br>'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk long enough.'
