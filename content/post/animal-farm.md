<!-- -->
> ...defending democracy involves destroying all independence of thought.

<!-- -->
> But how much of the present slide towards Fascist ways of thought is traceable to the ‘anti-Fascism’ of the past ten years and the unscrupulousness it has entailed?

<!-- -->
> If liberty means anything at all it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.
