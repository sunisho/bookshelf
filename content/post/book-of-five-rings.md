### Notable Excerpts

> Generally speaking, the Way of the warrior is resolute acceptance of death.

<!-- -->
> The principle of strategy is having one thing, to know ten thousand things.

<!-- -->
> It is difficult to know yourself if you do not know others.

<!-- -->
> You should not have a favourite weapon. To become over-familiar with one weapon is as much a fault as not knowing it sufficiently well.

<!-- -->
> You win battles with the timing in the Void born of the timing of cunning by knowing the enemies’ timing, and thus using a timing which the enemy does not expect.

<!-- -->
> <BR>1. Do not think dishonestly.<BR>2. The Way is in training.<BR>3. Become acquainted with every art.<BR>4. Know the Ways of all professions.<BR>5. Distinguish between gain and loss in worldly matters.<BR>6. Develop intuitive judgement and understanding for everything.<BR>7. Perceive those things which cannot be seen.<BR>8. Pay attention even to trifles.<BR>9. Do nothing which is of no use.

<!-- -->
> Today is victory over yourself of yesterday; tomorrow is your victory over lesser men.

<!-- -->
> Because you can win quickly by taking the lead, it is one of the most important things in strategy.

<!-- -->
> “To Hold Down a Pillow” means not allowing the enemy’s head to rise.

<!-- -->
> The important thing in strategy is to suppress the enemy’s useful actions but allow his useless actions.

<!-- -->
> In strategy also it is important to “cross at a ford.” Discern the enemy’s capability and, knowing your own strong points, “cross the ford” at the advantageous place, as a good captain crosses a sea route.

<!-- -->
> “To know the times” means to know the enemy’s disposition in battle.

<!-- -->
> In large-scale strategy, when the enemy starts to collapse, you must pursue him without letting the chance go. If you fail to take advantage of your enemies’ collapse, they may recover.

<!-- -->
> “To become the enemy” means to think yourself in the enemy’s position.

<!-- -->
> In large-scale strategy, when you cannot see the enemy’s position, indicate that you are about to attack strongly, to discover his resources.

<!-- -->
> Make a show of complete calmness, and the enemy will be taken by this and will become relaxed.

<!-- -->
> Many things can cause a loss of balance. One cause is danger, another is hardship, and another is surprise.

<!-- -->
> It is difficult to move strong things by pushing directly, so you should “injure the corners.”

<!-- -->
> In single combat, if the enemy is less skillful than ourself, if his rhythm is disorganised, or if he has fallen into evasive or retreating attitudes, we must crush him straightaway, with no concern for his presence and without allowing him space for breath. It is essential to crush him all at once. The primary thing is not to let him recover his position even a little.

<!-- -->
> The “mountain-sea” spirit means that it is bad to repeat the same thing several times when fighting the enemy. There may be no help but to do something twice, but do not try it a third time.

<!-- -->
> If the enemy thinks of the mountains, attack like the sea; and if he thinks of the sea, attack like the mountains.

<!-- -->
> If the enemy remains spirited it is difficult to crush him.

<!-- -->
> Whenever we have become preoccupied with small detail, we must suddenly change into a large spirit, interchanging large with small.

<!-- -->
> In this world it is said, “One inch gives the hand advantage,” but these are the idle words of one who does not know strategy. It shows the inferior strategy of a weak spirit that men should be dependent on the length of their sword, fighting from a distance without the benefit of strategy.

<!-- -->
> To aim for the enemy’s unguarded moment is completely defensive, and undesirable at close quarters with the enemy.

<!-- -->
> “Perception” and “sight” are the two methods of seeing.

<!-- -->
> In single combat you must not fix the eyes on the details

<!-- -->
> What is called the spirit of the void is where there is nothing. It is not included in man’s knowledge. Of course the void is nothingness. By knowing things that exist, you can know that which does not exist. That is the void.
