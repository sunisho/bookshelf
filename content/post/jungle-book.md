The Jungle Book extends far beyond the legend of Mowgli, telling the tales of animals and humans of all walks of life. Mowgli's upbringing and triumph over Shere Khan dominates the text, but Kipling offers several other stories to satiate readers who would rather not move on after Mowgli's story ends.
