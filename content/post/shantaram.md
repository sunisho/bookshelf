The unbelievable tale of an Australian convict who escaped a maximum security prison and found refuge on the streets of Bombay.

I started this book back in 2009 and only now took the time to complete it. This delay was due somewhat to a dislike to the writing, but moreso to my terrible habit of getting distracted.

It does drag at some points, and becomes repetitive and redundant at others, but every few pages the reader is offered some gem of inspirational philosophy that makes the journey of reading worth it.

This story also has the best depiction of life in India that I've ever read. The good, the bad, the fascinating, and the boring. It's all here.
