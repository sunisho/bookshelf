Truth be told, this was the first Dickens novel I've actually read in its entirety. I don't regret waiting this long, for it is not certain that I would have appreciated just how good of a writer and storyteller he was when I was younger.

I read this just in time for Christmas, in hopes to refresh my holiday spirit, so I may avoid the same haunted encounters that faced old Ebenezer Scrooge.

### Notable Excerpts

> But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country’s done for.

<!-- -->
> ...the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.

<!-- -->
> “Why do you doubt your senses?”<BR>“Because,” said Scrooge, “a little thing affects them. A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There’s more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!”

<!-- -->
> “I wear the chain I forged in life,” replied the Ghost. “I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it.

<!-- -->
> “Business!” cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. “Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!”

<!-- -->
> ...in short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest licence of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.

<!-- -->
> “There are some upon this earth of yours,” returned the Spirit, “who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin, as if they had never lived. Remember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us.”

<!-- -->
> Then Bob proposed: “A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!” Which all the family re-echoed. <BR><BR>“God bless us every one!” said Tiny Tim, the last of all.

<!-- -->
> It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour.

<!-- -->
> This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased. Deny it!”

<!-- -->
> ...for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in less attractive forms.
